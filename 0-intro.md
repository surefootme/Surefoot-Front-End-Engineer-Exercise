## Howdy, job seeker!

Below are 3 code exercises that will allow us to get a sense for your coding chops and give you exposure to the type of work you'd be doing on a regular basis to ensure you enjoy it. Our flavor of dev is a bit atypical in nature, and the exercises are designed to reflect that.

#### Instructions
1) Create a new gist containing the raw text from the below exercises
2) Name your gist `"yourName-surefoot-application.md"`
3) Add your code (in your new file) where indicated 
4) When complete, revisit the [job requirements](http://surefoot.me/jobs/engineer/) at the bottom of the description to ensure you're sending a complete application and :shipit:

Feel free to email jobs@surefoot.me with any questions.

---------------------------------------------------------
## Exercise 1: Form validation
*Hypothesis:* Adding form validation to the "name" and "message" fields of the email form will increase form submissions.

*Device type:* Desktop only  

*URL:* http://surefoot.me/engineer-application-sandbox/

*Dev notes:*
- Currently, the form doesn't check the validity of any information.
- Please execute your code on DOM ready and use AJAX to handle validation.
- Styling/layout of error messaging is up to you.
- Include a few lines of a README-esque description that explains your code to a non-technical person.

**Your code here:**

```
/* Form Validation Code */
```

## Exercise 2: Form restyling

*Hypothesis:* Swapping the position of the two forms and restyling the email form will increase email form submissions.

*Device type:* Desktop only

*URL:* http://surefoot.me/engineer-application-sandbox/

*Mockup:* https://goo.gl/oMM3Pe

*Dev notes:*
- Swap the positions of the "schedule a call" and email forms.
- Restyle the form to resemble the mockup but don't worry too much about pixel perfection.
- Include a few lines of a README-esque description that explains your code to a non-technical person.


**Your code here:**

```
/* Form Restyling Code */
```

## Exercise 3: Cookie monster

*Hypothesis:* Disallowing return users to resubmit the email form will decrease spam.

*Device:* Desktop only

*URL:* http://surefoot.me/engineer-application-sandbox/

*Dev Notes:*
- If user has already submitted the email form, don’t allow them to resubmit. Instead, show the message "Hmm, you look familiar. While you're waiting for our reply, here's a GIF we think you should see."
- GIF can be anything you desire.
- Styling of messaging is up to you.
- Include a few lines of a README-esque description that explains your code to a non-technical person.


**Your code here:**

```
/* Cookie Monster Code */
```

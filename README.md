# Howdy, job seeker!

Below are 3 code exercises that will allow us to get a sense for your coding chops and give you exposure to the type of work you'd be doing on a regular basis to ensure you enjoy it. This is isn’t your standard front-end dev gig, as you’ll be writing code that is inserted into websites via 3rd party testing tools like [Convert](https://www.convert.com/), [Dynamic Yield](https://www.dynamicyield.com/), and [Webtrends-Optimize](https://www.webtrends-optimize.com/). The below exercises are designed to reflect that.  

## Instructions
1) Create a [new gist](https://gist.new) containing the raw text from the below exercises
2) Name your gist `"yourName-surefoot-application.md"`
3) Add your code (in the gist) where indicated 
4) When complete, add the gist URL to your application and :shipit:
5) When prompted for the password for the targeted URLs below, enter "`foobar`"

Feel free to email jobs@surefoot.me with any questions.

### Exercise 1: Check yo' self

**Hypothesis:** We believe that adding custom form validation to fields of the contact form will increase valid form submissions.

**Device type:** Desktop only  

**Targeted URL:** https://www.surefoot.me/engineering-application-sandbox/

**Dev notes:**
- Currently, the form uses the [browser's default form validation](https://share.surefoot.me/geum7LO2). We want to use our own custom error messages instead. Requirements:
  - All fields are required.
  - Email field should contain a valid email address.
- Please execute your code on DOM ready and use javascript to handle validation.
- Styling/layout/text of error messaging is up to you, but please don't use `alert()`.
- Include a few lines of a README-esque description that explains your code to a non-technical person.

**Your code here:**

```js
/* Exercise #1 Code */

### Exercise 2: LTR, gator

**Hypothesis:** We believe that changing to a two-column layout will increase form submissions.

**Device type:** Desktop only

**Targeted URL:** https://www.surefoot.me/engineering-application-sandbox/

**Mockup:** https://share.surefoot.me/Z4u7NgvN

**Dev notes:**
- Change the layout so the purple banner is on the left and the form is on the right.
- Restyle the elements to resemble the mockup but don't worry too much about pixel perfection.
- Include a few lines of a README-esque description that explains your code to a non-technical person.


**Your code here:**

```js
/* Exercise #2 Code */

### Exercise 3: Cookie monster

**Hypothesis:** Disallowing return users to resubmit the email form will decrease spam.

**Device:** Mobile & Desktop

**Targeted URL:** https://www.surefoot.me/engineering-application-sandbox/

**Dev Notes:**
- If user has already submitted the form, don’t allow them to resubmit. Instead, show the message "Hmm, you look familiar. While you're waiting for our reply, here's a GIF we think you should see."
- GIF can be anything you desire.
- Styling of messaging is up to you, but make sure it looks good on targeted device types!
- Include a few lines of a README-esque description that explains your code to a non-technical person.
